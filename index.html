<p>Recently I had the opportunity to create a Sinatra app for the coding bootcamp I'm enrolled in. Since running is one of my interests 
outside of coding, I decided to create a basic Sinatra app to keep track of a user's workout activity. To do this I used the classic
MVC (models, views, controllers) design pattern which is oft used in these kinds of applications. I used ActiveRecord to make two databases,
one for user data and one for workout data. The users table stores an individual's username, email, and an encrypted password for their
account. The workout table has keys for the date/time of the workout, distance, intensity, and a foreign key corresponding to the user who
created the workout instance.
